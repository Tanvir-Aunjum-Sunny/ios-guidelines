# iOS Guidelines

Lists guidelines for design, development and distribution of our iOS apps. This is an attempt to clearly document the conventions used and encourage best practices that accomplish following goals:

The [ios-design-guidelines](https://github.com/nrccua/testflight-distribution-guidelines-ios/blob/master/ios-design-guidelines.md) is intended to define a common overarching style that guides the design of our iOS apps. Have a consistent look and feel for colour schemes, fonts, patterns and layouts within an app and across apps.

The [ios-development-guidelines](https://github.com/nrccua/testflight-distribution-guidelines-ios/blob/master/ios-development-guidelines.md) is intended to define clear, consistent and succinct ways for implementing common patterns in code. 

The [ios-distribution-guidelines](https://github.com/nrccua/testflight-distribution-guidelines-ios/blob/master/ios-distribution-guidelines.md) is intended to define simple, step-by-step guidance for enrolling in the TestFlight system, installing beta builds and providing feedback to the devs.

This repo is public to ensure access to all stakeholders irrespective of their GitHub membership.
